###Priorities

1. Gtk Application and preventing multiple instances
2. Insensitive checks in Appearance sections
3. Installation and removable themes in Appearance sections
4. Prevent crashing upon missing schema / key -- AssertionError
       - Mainly Touchpad (Under System Section - Touch - Scrolling and
       - Overlay scrollbar (Under System Section - Scrollbars)
5. [Only on 13.04] Launcher icon size can be set below 32 -- up to 8 pixels.
6. Prevent same keybindings from being set
